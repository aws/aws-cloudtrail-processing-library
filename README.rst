AWS CloudTrail Processing Library
=================================

The |library| is a Java client library that makes it easy to build an application that reads and processes
CloudTrail log files in a fault tolerant and highly scalable manner.

* `CloudTrail Forum <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=168/>`_
* `Github Issues <https://github.com/aws/aws-cloudtrail-processing-library/issues/>`_


Features
--------

* Provides functionality to continuously download CloudTrail log files in a fault tolerant and scalable manner.

* Serializes the events in JSON format to Plain Old Java Objects (POJO).

* Provides interfaces to implement your own business logic for selecting which events to process, processing events,
  handling errors, and handling log processing status updates.
